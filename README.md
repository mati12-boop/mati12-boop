## 👋 About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate** in the EPSRC Nuclear Energy Futures CDT at Imperial College London, specialising in **thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) modelling of bentonite barriers** for the geological disposal of radioactive waste. My research develops and validates advanced mathematical and computational models to describe coupled processes in nuclear systems, supporting the safe and sustainable management of radioactive waste.

Previously, I completed an **MSc of Science by Research in Nuclear Physics** at the University of York as a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow (IAEA, 2020/2021)**, where I investigated nuclear structure and mass formulas for a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions.
